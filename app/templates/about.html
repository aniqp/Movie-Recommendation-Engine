      <h1>About this project</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
          This project implements a content-based movie recommendation engine using a cosine similarity algorithm and the NumPy, pandas and scikit-learn libraries.
          I loved learning a new machine learning technique as well as web development in Flask! I hope you enjoy using this app as much as I did creating it.
